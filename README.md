# Codedex_hackathon

I used the dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) called [120 Years of Olympic history: Atheletes and results](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results/data) to perform a exploratory data analysis on the winning countries in Olympics over the course of the years.

The purpose of the project is to provide a deep insight on how the countries have performed in the Olympics and how performance differs for each country with time.
